faq-43,FAQ,US,Help! I don't know how to read my prescription.,"No worries--we've got you covered. Here are some terms you'll see on both glasses and contacts prescriptions: OD: This abbreviation stands for ""oculus dexter,"" which is ""right eye"" in Latin. OS: This abbreviation stands for ""oculus sinister,"" which is ""left eye"" in Latin. Sphere (SPH): Sphere indicates how strong your lenses need to be. This will be accompanied by (+) or (-), which indicates whether you're farsighted or nearsighted.Cylinder (CYL): Cylinder is the correction for astigmatism. Astigmatism (thanks for asking!) means that the shape of your cornea prevents you from seeing with perfect sharpness. If you have a cylinder included on your contact lens prescription, that usually means you wear toric lenses.ADD: This is used when you require a prescription for both distance and reading in your glasses or contact lenses. It can be shown as an ADD value with a plus (+) sign with a number or, for certain contact lens brands, a description like ""high"" or ""low."" An ADD indicates that you may need progressive or multifocal lenses. Here are a few additional terms you'll see on a contact lens prescription: Base curve (BC): For contact lenses, the base curve helps the lens fit properly. This usually is a number between 8 and 10 that measures the curve of a contact lens.Diameter (Dia): This is the width across a contact lens in millimeters. Most contact lenses are 13-15 mm wide.Brand: The part of the prescription that specifies which kind of contacts have been prescribed to you. For contact lenses, we are only able to fulfill the brand of lenses prescribed by your doctor. Color: Many contacts have a slightly visible tint to help you see them against different surfaces. (It's common to see blue tint or handling tint listed on your contact lens packaging.) Certain contacts may have a color tint to enhance or change the color of your eyes while you wear them. This has no effect on your vision, but it's still important to get a prescription by a doctor to make sure they fit your eyes properly.Want to know more cool stuff about glasses and contact lenses?

faq-45,FAQ,US,Do you offer bifocal or progressive lenses?,"We offer progressive glasses starting at $295 and progressive sunglasses starting at $375. We do not currently offer bifocal lenses, but if your doctor has written this type of prescription for you (with an ADD power), we can fill it as progressives or single-vision. If you would like single-vision lenses, please write your preference for distance or reading right on the prescription itself."
faq-46,FAQ,US,What is the difference between single-vision and progressive lenses?,"Single-vision lenses offer one correction throughout the entire lens (usually for distance or reading). Progressive lenses offer multiple focal corrections in one lens, providing a seamless transition from distance correction on top to reading correction on bottom. This means you can see your whole field of vision without switching between multiple pairs of glasses. Neat.If you have any additional questions about progressives, we're happy to help. Chat with us here."
faq-47,FAQ,US,Do you offer light-responsive lenses? ,"We offer light-responsive lenses in our entire collection of eyeglasses starting at $195.

For day-to-day cleaning of light smudges, a few swipes of the lens cloth included in your case should do the trick. Please be careful to avoid using hot water on your lenses (especially if they are high-index lenses), as they can develop bubbles or cracks when exposed to high heat."
faq-50,FAQ,US,Do your glasses offer protection from blue light?,"For customers who are concerned about exposure to blue light, we offer polycarbonate blue-light-filtering lenses for an additional $50. These lenses block more blue light than our standard polycarbonate lenses or our high-index lenses, and they can be added to your order during checkout.If you're planning on wearing your glasses both indoors and outdoors, we'd recommend our light-responsive lenses (which darken from clear to grey when exposed to sunlight) as an alternative. Many people's primary source of blue light exposure is the sun, and these lenses provide more blue light filtration when exposed to sunlight than most blue-light-filtering lenses (including ours) do. If you're interested, these lenses cost an additional $100 and can be selected when adding frames to your cart."
